# Morsel
Morsel is a microblogging service, like Twitter, but with a system of boards,
which allows users to choose what they want to see on their timeline.

The work on this project is far from over and it's still under very highly
active development. Right now, Morsel is capable of:
* User registration
* Fairly insecure logins
* Board creation (using the Python interpreter and `morsel_util.py`)
* Posting to boards

Several features are under active development on a test server, but are not
merged to the Git repository:
* User pages
* Timelines
* User follows
* Board creation from the web UI
